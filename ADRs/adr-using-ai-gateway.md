# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: AI Gateway for LLM Observability, Governance and more

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** [2025-02-13]

## Context  

To ensure responsible and efficient usage of large language models (LLMs), we require an AI gateway that provides observability, logging, metrics, prompt validation, and guardrails. This gateway will help monitor model interactions, enforce compliance policies, and improve system reliability. Additionally, it will enable better debugging, performance tuning, and security enforcement for AI-driven applications.

## Decision  

We have decided to implement an AI gateway to centralize observability and governance for LLMs. This gateway will provide:

- **LLM Observability**: Real-time monitoring of API requests and responses.
- **Logging & Metrics**: Capturing detailed logs and performance metrics.
- **Prompt Validation**: Ensuring prompts adhere to predefined guidelines to prevent misuse.
- **Guardrails**: Enforcing compliance and security policies, including content filtering and ethical constraints.

This AI gateway will serve as an intermediary between AI applications and LLM providers, ensuring controlled access, visibility, and governance.

## Consequences  

**Positive impacts:**

- Improved **transparency and accountability** through detailed logs and observability.
- Enhanced **security and compliance** via prompt validation and guardrails.
- Better **debugging and optimization** through performance metrics and analysis.
- Centralized **governance and policy enforcement** for AI interactions.

**Negative impacts and Trade-offs:**

- **Increased latency due to additional processing in the gateway:** The observability and validation mechanisms introduce some overhead.
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize request pipelines, leverage caching, and minimize synchronous processing.
- **Complex integration with existing AI systems:** Implementing a gateway requires refactoring existing AI workflows.
  - **Mitigation:** Provide standardized APIs and SDKs to ease adoption.
- **Potential scalability challenges with high-volume traffic:** The AI gateway may become a bottleneck under heavy loads.
  - **Mitigation:** Deploy a distributed, scalable architecture with load balancing and autoscaling mechanisms.

## Alternatives Considered  

1. **Direct Integration with LLM APIs:**
   - Simple setup but lacks centralized monitoring, governance, and control.
2. **Decentralized Logging and Metrics Collection:**
   - Offers flexibility but increases complexity in data aggregation and analysis.
3. **Manual Compliance and Security Audits:**
   - Reactive approach that does not scale well for real-time monitoring and enforcement.
