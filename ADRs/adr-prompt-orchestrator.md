# Title

Decision Record: Selection of an LLM Prompt Orchestrator Framework

Date:  [2025-02-20]

## Status

Proposed

## Context

In developing our Automatic Grading System for short answers, proper orchestration of LLM prompts is crucial. The system must manage complex prompt chains, handle varying LLM responses, incorporate context, and ensure low latency alongside high reliability. The chosen framework will influence how we build our prompt pipelines, log and monitor prompt performance, and iterate on our prompt design. It must be flexible, support modular composition of prompts (prompt chains), integrate seamlessly with various LLM providers, and enable rapid prototyping and refinement of our grading logic.

## Alternatives

1. LangChain

   - Mature and popular orchestration framework with an extensive suite of modular components.
   - Robust prompt chaining, memory management, and high customization capabilities.
   - Extensive community support and frequent updates.
   - Seamless integration with multiple LLM backends.

2. PromptLayer

   - Focuses on prompt logging and monitoring while offering some orchestration features.
   - Enables tracking of prompt performance and iterative prompt improvements.
   - May introduce additional latency or overhead due to intensive logging.
   - Less comprehensive in managing complex prompt chains compared to LangChain.

3. In-House Custom Orchestrator

   - Custom-built solution tailored precisely to the grading system’s requirements.
   - Provides complete control over orchestration, logging, and integration aspects.
   - Requires significant development and ongoing maintenance effort.
   - Increases risk in terms of reliability and extends time-to-market.

4. Other Emerging Frameworks (e.g., LlamaIndex)
   - Some niche frameworks offer functionalities like indexing combined with prompt enhancements.
   - May have limited documentation and community support.
   - Might not cover all the orchestration needs of an end-to-end automatic grading system.

## PrOACT

### Problem:

We need an orchestration framework to effectively manage and sequence LLM prompt interactions that accurately grade short answers while remaining modular, easy to integrate, and maintainable.

### Objectives:

- Enable dynamic prompt chaining and context management.
- Ensure ease of integration with various LLM backends (e.g., GPT variants, etc.).
- Provide facilities for prompt logging, monitoring, and rapid iteration.
- Minimize latency and maximize system reliability.
- Reduce development overhead for faster prototyping and deployment.

### Alternatives Considered:

- LangChain  
- PromptLayer  
- In-House Custom Orchestrator
- Emerging Frameworks like LlamaIndex

### Constraints:

- Limited engineering resources available for developing and maintaining a fully custom solution.
- Must integrate seamlessly within our existing microservices architecture.
- The framework must support scalability as student usage grows.

### Tradeoffs:

- Relying on a third-party framework like LangChain can introduce external dependency risks and some constraints on customization, but it greatly accelerates development using well-tested components.
- Using PromptLayer adds robust monitoring but may add latency and require additional tooling for prompt orchestration.
- Building a custom orchestrator offers maximal control but increases development time, complexity, and long-term maintenance efforts.

## Decision

After evaluating the alternatives, we have decided to adopt LangChain as the core LLM prompt orchestrator framework for this project. LangChain delivers the best balance of robust orchestration capabilities, integration flexibility, community support, and rapid development benefits. Its modular design supports building complex prompt chains, and its active ecosystem is an asset for addressing development and maintenance challenges. Although it introduces an external dependency, its continued evolution and thorough documentation make it a sustainable choice for our long-term roadmap.

## Tradeoffs and Mitigations

### Dependency on a Third-Party Framework (LangChain)

- Tradeoff: Relying on LangChain introduces an external dependency, potentially limiting customization and forcing us to work within its design constraints.
- Mitigation: Abstract the orchestration layer behind our own API. This abstraction facilitates switching frameworks or modifying functionality with minimal impact on core business logic.

### Potential Overhead from Added Abstraction

- Tradeoff: The additional abstraction provided by the chosen framework may increase processing latency and system complexity.
- Mitigation: Optimize prompt chains by profiling and refining orchestration code. Continuously monitor performance and conduct load testing to ensure latency stays within acceptable thresholds.

### Limited Customization Compared to a Fully In-House Solution

- Tradeoff: While LangChain is flexible, it may not cover every unique requirement of our grading logic as comprehensively as a custom solution.
- Mitigation: Leverage LangChain’s extensibility features to implement custom modules where needed. Develop well-defined interfaces, so that individual components can be replaced or extended as the grading logic evolves.

### Documentation and Learning Curve

- Tradeoff: The team will face an initial learning curve adapting to LangChain and its ecosystem.
- Mitigation: Allocate time for team training and experimentation during early project phases. Create and maintain internal documentation and best practices to ensure efficient use of LangChain throughout the project lifecycle.

This decision is intended to provide a robust, flexible, and scalable solution for orchestrating LLM prompts within our automatic grading system, while effectively managing inherent tradeoffs through careful planning and strategic mitigations.
