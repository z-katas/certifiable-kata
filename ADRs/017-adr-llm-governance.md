# ADR-017: LLM Governance Architecture Decision Record

## Status
**Approved**

## Context
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in applications that involve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In such systems, ensuring that unauthorized, sensitive, or unverified content is not retrieved or exposed is a critical governance requirement. Without strong governance mechanisms, LLMs can inadvertently retrieve and generate inappropriate, biased, or harmful responses, leading to security, ethical, and compliance risks.

### Alternatives
1. **Unrestricted Retrieval** - Allowing the model to access all indexed data without content filtering.
2. **Rule-based Filtering** - Using predefined rules to exclude certain content categories.
3. **AI-driven Moderation** - Implementing AI-driven content filtering to detect and block unauthorized information dynamically.
4. **Access-Control Lists (ACLs) & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Restricting retrieval access based on user roles and permissions.
5. **Provenance and Trust Scores** - Attaching metadata and trust levels to retrieved content for governance.

### PrOACT
- **Problem Definition**: Ensure LLMs retrieve only authorized, relevant, and appropriate content while preventing exposure of sensitive or harmful information.
- **Objectives**:
  - Prevent unauthorized content retrieval.
  - Ensure compliance with regulatory and ethical standards.
  - Maintain response accuracy and reliability.
- **Alternatives**: Discussed above.
- **Consequences**:
  - Poor governance may lead to misinformation, security risks, and legal issues.
  - Over-restriction can impact usability and model effectiveness.
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Strong governance might slightly reduce retrieval efficiency.
  - More dynamic approaches may increase computational costs.

## Decision
We will implement a **multi-layered governance approach** that includes:
1. **Access-Control Mechanisms**: Implement RBAC and ACLs to restrict retrieval based on user roles.
2. **Content Moderation Filters**: Use AI-based and rule-based filtering to detect and block unauthorized content.
3. **Data Provenance & Trust Scores**: Attach metadata to retrieved documents, ensuring only verified sources are used.
4. **Auditing and Logging**: Maintain logs of retrieval activities for compliance and monitoring.
5. **Dynamic Policy Enforcement**: Adapt retrieval policies based on contextual requirements and governance updates.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
| **Risk**                                  | **Tradeoff**                                      | **Mitigation**                              |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Exposure of Unauthorized Content**     | Stricter filters may reduce access to useful data | Implement dynamic filtering and RBAC   |
| **Performance Overhead**                  | Governance checks may slow down retrieval        | Optimize indexing and caching strategies |
| **User Friction**                         | Excessive restrictions may impact usability      | Provide user-specific access policies    |
| **False Positives in Content Filtering**  | Important data may be wrongly blocked            | Use AI-driven adaptive filtering         |
| **Compliance & Audit Complexity**         | Managing logs and policies can be resource-intensive | Automate governance policy enforcement |

By integrating these governance strategies, we ensure that LLM-powered applications maintain security, reliability, and ethical standards while enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in RAG-based architectures.
