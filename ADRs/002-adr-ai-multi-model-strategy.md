# ADR-002: Multi-Model AI Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** [2025-02-13]

## Context  
We have a Test 2 which is a case study where accuracy and reliability are critical. The AI system must process C2 diagrams, other ADRs, business documents, non-functional requirement analysis, and call flow diagrams. Given the diversity of these tasks, a single AI model may not be sufficient to deliver the required performance, necessitating a multi-model AI strategy.

## Decision  
We have decided to adopt a multi-model AI strategy, where different AI models will be utilized based on the specific requirements of each use case. Specialized models will be chosen for tasks such as:
- NLP models for processing ADRs, business documents, and non-functional requirement analysis.
- Vision models for analyzing C2 diagrams and call flow diagrams.
- Hybrid models combining structured and unstructured data processing for complex decision-making.

This strategy will ensure optimal accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in AI-driven tasks.

## Consequences  
**Positive impacts:**
- Increased accuracy by leveraging task-specific AI models.
- Higher reliability through redundancy and fallback mechanisms.
- Scalability to accommodate future AI advancements and new use cases.

**Negative impacts and Trade-offs:**
- **Increased complexity in model management and orchestration:** Managing multiple AI models requires a robust architecture for deployment, monitoring, and updates. 
  - **Mitigation:** Implementing automated MLOps pipelines and model versioning can streamline management.
- **Higher computational costs due to multiple models running in parallel:** Running multiple specialized models can lead to increased infrastructure costs.
   - **Mitigation:** Optimize resource allocation by using on-demand scaling and efficient model selection mechanisms.
- **Need for continuous monitoring and model retraining to maintain performance:** Different models may degrade at different rates, requiring regular updates and validation. 
  - **Mitigation:** Establish periodic evaluation processes and feedback loops to fine-tune models based on real-world performance.

## Alternatives Considered  
1. **Single Model Approach:**
   - Simpler implementation but lacks the flexibility and accuracy needed for diverse use cases.
2. **Multi model Processing:**
   - Reliable for diverse use cases and structured tasks but lacks adaptability for complex AI-driven insights.
3. **Hybrid Model with Fine-Tuning:**
   - A single base model fine-tuned for different tasks, but may not perform optimally across all domains.
