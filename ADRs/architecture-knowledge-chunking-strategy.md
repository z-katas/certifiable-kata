# Document Chunking Strategy for Knowledge Base Vector Store

## Status
**Implemented**

## Context
To generate aptitude test questions and case studies on new architecture patterns, trends, and techniques, we need to store relevant information in a knowledge base vector store. Effective retrieval depends on how documents are chunked before embedding into the vector store. Choosing the right chunking strategy is critical to ensure optimal semantic retrieval, query relevance, and storage efficiency.

### Alternatives
1. **Character Chunking** - Splits text into fixed-size character chunks (e.g., every 500 characters).
2. **Recursive Character Chunking** - Similar to character chunking but tries to break at logical boundaries like sentence endings.
3. **Document-Specific Chunking** - Uses domain-specific heuristics to define chunk boundaries (e.g., sections in research papers).
4. **Semantic Chunking** - Splits text into semantically coherent chunks based on meaning, often using NLP techniques.
5. **Token Chunking** - Splits text into fixed-size token chunks, ensuring compatibility with LLM token limits.
6. **Agent Chunking** - Uses an AI agent to dynamically determine optimal chunks based on content type and retrieval needs.

### PrOACT Analysis
**Problem:** Ensure relevant and efficient retrieval from the vector store to support question and case study generation.

**Objectives:**
- Preserve semantic meaning within chunks.
- Optimize retrieval relevance.
- Minimize redundant storage and processing costs.

**Alternatives Evaluation:**
| Chunking Type             | Semantic Integrity | Query Relevance | Storage Efficiency | Complexity |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Character Chunking       | Low               | Low            | High              | Low        |
| Recursive Character Chunking | Medium        | Medium         | Medium            | Medium     |
| Document-Specific Chunking | High           | High           | Medium            | High       |
| Semantic Chunking        | Very High        | Very High      | Medium            | High       |
| Token Chunking           | Medium           | Medium         | High              | Medium     |
| Agent Chunking           | Very High        | Very High      | Medium            | Very High  |

**Consequences and Tradeoffs:**
- **Character-based chunking** is simple but loses semantic integrity.
- **Recursive character chunking** improves readability but lacks deep semantic awareness.
- **Document-specific chunking** ensures domain relevance but requires custom rules per document type.
- **Semantic chunking** enables the most meaningful retrieval but has higher computational costs.
- **Token chunking** balances efficiency but might still split semantically linked content.
- **Agent chunking** is the most advanced but requires dynamic inference, increasing cost and complexity.

## Decision
**Semantic Chunking** is the chosen approach due to its superior query relevance and semantic integrity. While it incurs additional processing overhead, it ensures better retrieval for generating test questions and case studies. Document-specific chunking will be used as a fallback for structured documents like research papers.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Processing Cost:** Optimize embeddings by batching processing and caching frequently accessed data.
- **Chunk Boundary Precision:** Use hybrid strategies (e.g., combine semantic and document-specific chunking for structured documents).
- **Retrieval Performance:** Fine-tune embedding models and vector similarity search parameters to improve accuracy.

This decision balances accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability, ensuring a robust knowledge base for automated question and case study generation.
