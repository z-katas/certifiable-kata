# ADR-016: LLM Security Architecture Decision Record

## Status
**Approved**  

## Context
With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, ensuring their security is critical. LLMs introduce unique vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly addressed. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for LLM security highlight key risks that must be mitigated to protect systems from attacks such as prompt injection, model poisoning, and data leakage.

### OWASP Top 10 LLM Security Vulnerabilities & Mitigation Strategies
1. **Prompt Injection**
   - *Threat:* Malicious users craft inputs that alter the modelâ€™s behavior in unintended ways.
   - *Mitigation:* Use input sanitization, contextual filtering, and strict prompt validation.

2. **Data Leakage**
   - *Threat:* Sensitive or confidential information unintentionally exposed by the model.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement data anonymization, restrict training data, and use differential privacy techniques.

3. **Insecure Plugin Design**
   - *Threat:* External integrations can introduce security risks.
   - *Mitigation:* Apply API security best practices, restrict permissions, and conduct security audits.

4. **Excessive Agency**
   - *Threat:* LLMs making decisions autonomously without adequate oversight.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement human-in-the-loop verification and limit the scope of autonomous decisions.

5. **Model Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - *Threat:* Attackers overwhelm the system with complex queries, causing resource exhaustion.
   - *Mitigation:* Rate limiting, anomaly detection, and query complexity restrictions.

6. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
   - *Threat:* Using compromised third-party libraries or datasets.
   - *Mitigation:* Secure supply chain management, dependency verification, and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) tracking.

7. **Training Data Poisoning**
   - *Threat:* Malicious actors inject biased or incorrect data into training sets.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement data validation, anomaly detection, and adversarial training techniques.

8. **Output Manipulation**
   - *Threat:* Attackers influence LLM outputs to spread misinformation.
   - *Mitigation:* Fact-checking mechanisms, adversarial testing, and confidence scoring of responses.

9. **Insecure Model Hosting**
   - *Threat:* Unprotected endpoints expose models to unauthorized access.
   - *Mitigation:* Secure API gateways, authentication mechanisms, and network segmentation.

10. **Over-reliance on LLM Outputs**
   - *Threat:* Users trust LLM-generated content without verification.
   - *Mitigation:* Educate users, include disclaimers, and implement verification layers.

### Alternatives
- Deploying rule-based security mechanisms instead of ML-driven ones.
- Using smaller, domain-specific models instead of general-purpose LLMs.
- Relying on human oversight for all critical AI decisions.

### PrOACT (Problem, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, Trade-offs)
**Problem:** LLM security risks can lead to data breaches, misinformation, and compromised systems.  
**Objectives:** Implement robust security practices while maintaining model performance and usability.  
**Alternatives:** Adopt different security architectures, training methodologies, and access control mechanisms.  
**Consequences:** Over-securing may impact usability, while under-securing can lead to exploits.  
**Trade-offs:** Balancing security, cost, and system performance.

## Decision
The security architecture will implement a **layered security approach** combining:
- **Input validation and prompt filtering** to prevent prompt injection.
- **Strict API security and plugin validation** to mitigate integration risks.
- **Monitoring and anomaly detection** for runtime security.
- **Fact-checking and human verification layers** for critical decisions.
- **Access control and encryption** to protect sensitive data.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Performance vs Security:** Some mitigations, like input filtering, may add latency.
- **Usability vs Security:** Overly restrictive policies may limit model capabilities.
- **Cost vs Security:** Implementing robust monitoring and threat detection incurs additional costs.
- **Scalability vs Security:** Rate limiting may prevent high-volume legitimate queries but is necessary to prevent DoS attacks.

By implementing these mitigations, we ensure that LLM applications remain **secure, reliable, and resilient** against evolving threats.
