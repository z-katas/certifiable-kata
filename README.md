## Introduction

### Background & Context

Certifiable, Inc. is a **leading software architecture certification provider** in the U.S., accredited by the **Software Architecture Licensing Board (SALB)**. Due to new legislation in **the UK, Europe, and Asia**, software architects in these regions must now obtain **official certification** similar to doctors and lawyers. Rather than creating their own certification process, **international licensing boards have decided to adopt U.S. certification programs**, significantly increasing demand for Certifiable, Inc.â€™s services.

Currently, Certifiable, Inc. processes **200 certification candidates per week**, but with **global expansion, demand is expected to grow 5-10X**. The company guarantees a **one-week turnaround time** for certification grading, but with the increase in applicants, their **manual grading process will become unsustainable**. 

To address this challenge, Certifiable, Inc. seeks **architectural innovations leveraging Generative AI** to ensure scalable, efficient, and cost-effective certification processing. Our team will explore AI integration to **automate grading workflows, optimize certification processes, and maintain industry credibility** while supporting rapid expansion.

### Key Objectives

- **Scalability & Infrastructure Readiness:** Ensure Certifiable, Inc. can handle a **5-10X increase in candidates** while maintaining a **1-week grading turnaround**.
- **Certification Integrity & Accuracy:** Implement AI-based solutions that **match or exceed expert grading accuracy**, ensuring fairness and reliability.
- **Operational Efficiency & Cost Management:** Reduce grading costs **without compromising quality**, ensuring cost-effective AI deployment.
- **AI-Augmented Certification Workflows:** Automate **test grading, candidate evaluation, and certification verification** using AI-powered frameworks.
- **Compliance & Global Adaptability:** Ensure certification programs align with **international standards**, maintaining credibility in new markets.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to **redefine Certifiable, Inc.'s certification architecture** while ensuring seamless expansion without sacrificing accuracy, compliance, or cost efficiency.
