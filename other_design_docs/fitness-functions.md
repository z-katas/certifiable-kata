## 1. Candidate screening/Evaluation Accuracy  
**Objective:** Ensure that the scoring mechanism correctly differentiates between expert-level and generalist-level responses.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function compares actual candidate scores with expected benchmark scores. A high accuracy score means the evaluation system is correctly assessing candidates. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating high evaluation accuracy.  

---

## 2. Test Fairness (Score Distribution)  
**Objective:** Ensure test difficulty is balanced, avoiding excessive failures or perfect scores.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function measures fairness by analyzing the distribution of test scores. Ideally, scores should be spread across a reasonable range, with a mean around 70% and a standard deviation of approximately 15. A score close to 1 indicates that the test difficulty is well-balanced.

## 3. Question Difficulty Balance  
**Objective:** Ensure that questions vary in difficulty and are neither too easy nor too hard.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function evaluates how well-balanced the difficulty levels of test questions are. An ideal distribution consists of a mix of easy (80%+ correct), medium (40-80% correct), and hard questions (<40% correct). A balance score near 1 indicates an appropriate distribution.

## 4. Architecture Scalability (Test Processing System)  
**Objective:** Ensure the certification system can handle a growing number of candidates.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function measures system scalability by comparing the current number of candidates taking the test to the maximum system capacity. A higher score means the system is handling load effectively, whereas a lower score indicates the system is nearing overload.  

---

## 5. Certification Process Efficiency  
**Objective:** Ensure candidates receive timely evaluations.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function assesses the efficiency of the evaluation process by comparing the average time taken to assess a test against a predefined maximum acceptable time. A score near 1 indicates that evaluations are completed quickly and efficiently.  

---

## 6. AI grading accuracy   
**Objective:** Ensure AI grading of candidates in the testing process is accurate.  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function assesses the accuracy in AI grading by comparing the actual grading given by an expert who would have overriden the grade given by AI (if there is a deviation). A score near 1 indicates that AI grading is highly accurate and requires lesser manual intervention going forward.  

---

## 7. Certification Credibility 
**Objective:** Ensure the current credibility of the certification process is intact or maybe even increase  

**Fitness Function:**  
This function assesses the credibility in the new certification process, the number of candidates accepting the feedback for failures and lesser queries, also a feedback survey form at the end . A score near 1 indicates that current certification is highly credible.

| **System Scalability**              | Handle increasing candidate load             | Score close to 1   |
| **Certification Process Efficiency**| Reduce evaluation time                       | Score close to 1   |
| **AI grading Accuracy**             | Reduce evaluation time and scale             | Score close to 1   |
| **Certification Credibility**       | Increase the certification reputation        | Score close to 1   |

These fitness functions help maintain a **reliable, scalable, and fair certification system**.
