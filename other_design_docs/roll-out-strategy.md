### Approach
- AI and human grading run in parallel to measure accuracy and refine AI decisions.
- Implement AI grading pipelines with confidence scoring to flag uncertain cases.
- A/B test AI prompting techniques to optimize structured feedback.
- Experts review AI-graded responses, ensuring alignment with certification standards.

### Key Functional Implementations
✅ AI-driven short-answer grading prototype with real-time feedback.  
✅ Case study evaluation pilot using LLM as a Judge to assess rubric-based scoring.  
✅ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for continuous model tuning.  

### Non-Functional Priorities
🔍 **Grading Consistency Tracking** – AI vs. human score deviations.  
🔍 **Explainability & Bias Mitigation** – Ensure AI provides clear, fair, and justified responses.  
🔍 **Performance & Compliance Monitoring** – Ensure secure handling of certification data.  

### Monitoring & KPIs
📊 AI vs. human grading alignment (% similarity in evaluation).  
📊 Reduction in manual grading time vs. traditional process.  
📊 AI confidence levels & flagged cases for expert review.

## Phase 2: AI-First with Expert Oversight (Controlled Expansion)
**Objective:** AI handles primary grading, with expert intervention in low-confidence cases.

### Approach
- Confidence-based workflows trigger human review for ambiguous cases.
- AI-generated structured feedback ensures candidates receive clear improvement guidance.
- **Adaptive Learning System** – AI learns from expert interventions and refines decision-making.

### Key Functional Implementations
✅ AI-driven grading expansion for short answers & case studies.  
✅ Fraud detection models to prevent misuse and ensure certification integrity.  
✅ HITL remains active, but experts handle only flagged edge cases.  

### Non-Functional Priorities
🔍 **System Scalability** – Ensure AI can handle 10X demand without performance degradation.  
🔍 **Real-time Feedback Processing** – Ensure AI explanations are interpretable and actionable.  
🔍 **Security & Compliance Audits** – Align AI with GDPR, ISO 27001 certification policies.  

### Monitoring & KPIs
📊 Reduction in expert intervention workload (target: 50% fewer manual reviews).  
📊 Feedback Clarity Score (evaluated by candidates & experts).  
📊 Accuracy of AI-flagged anomalies & fraud detection success rate.  

---

## Phase 3: Fully Autonomous AI Grading (Scale & Optimize)
**Objective:** Achieve high-accuracy AI grading, with minimal human involvement focused on oversight.

### Approach
- AI autonomously grades all certification submissions, but HITL remains for validation.
- Experts audit AI decisions, intervening only in complex cases.
- Continuous model monitoring ensures fairness, compliance, and efficiency.

### Key Functional Implementations
✅ AI fully deployed for Test 1 & Test 2 grading with near-zero delay.  
✅ Self-optimizing feedback loops – AI refines scoring based on expert adjustments.  
✅ Fraud & anomaly detection models for long-term certification integrity.  

### Non-Functional Priorities
🔍 **Cost Optimization** – Ensure AI grading stays within budget constraints.  
🔍 **Ongoing Monitoring** – Detect grading inconsistencies & bias dynamically.  
🔍 **HITL Becomes More Efficient** – Expert interventions are faster and batch-based.  

### Monitoring & KPIs
📊 >90% AI grading accuracy (compared to human baselines).  
📊 Expert intervention rate below 10% of cases.  
📊 Detection of anomalies & fraud prevention success.
